      <div class="about">
        <p>I am a Software Engineer with 10 years of experience as web developer. I am also a open source lover and
          contributor that believes contributing is a great way to improve skills and help community.</p>

        <p>I started my journey by implementing a document management system called GED in Java and PHP that was later
          adopted by Brazilian Government (TRT-PB).</p>

        <p>After that, I worked with government’s system of retirees and pensioners and reduced their most critical
          app's
          response from seconds to milliseconds by using software engineering best practices with complete redesign and
          overhauling
          their application.</p>

        <p>Later, I worked on a big sports betting software, a robust system that can handle a high load of people at
          the
          same time, ensuring the resilience of the app and high availability. I helped scale the application to several
          hundreds of thousands of requests per second by using go parallelism techniques to process requests using
          Golang goroutines.</p>

        <p>I am also maintained some of the Air Force systems.</p>
